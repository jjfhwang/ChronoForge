# ChronoForge: Decentralized Crypto-Asset Automation Engine

Orchestrating on-chain automation with smart contracts and gas-optimized transaction sequencing.

## Detailed Description

ChronoForge is a Python-based framework designed to facilitate decentralized automation of crypto-asset transactions and interactions with smart contracts. It provides developers with a robust and flexible platform to build complex on-chain workflows triggered by specific events or conditions. This eliminates the need for centralized intermediaries and empowers users to automate their digital asset management in a secure and trustless manner.

The core purpose of ChronoForge is to streamline the creation, deployment, and execution of automated strategies within the blockchain ecosystem. It achieves this by leveraging a combination of smart contract deployments, event listeners, and gas-optimized transaction sequencing techniques. The framework handles the complexities of interacting with various blockchain networks, allowing developers to focus on defining their desired automation logic. This includes features like scheduled payments, automated rebalancing of portfolios, and triggering actions based on price movements or other on-chain data.

ChronoForge offers significant benefits to developers and users alike. By automating complex on-chain processes, it reduces manual effort and the potential for human error. The decentralized nature of the platform eliminates reliance on centralized entities, enhancing security and transparency. The gas optimization strategies employed minimize transaction costs, making automation more accessible and efficient. Furthermore, ChronoForge provides a modular and extensible architecture, allowing developers to easily integrate new functionalities and adapt the framework to their specific needs.

## Key Features

*   **Smart Contract Abstraction Layer:** Provides a high-level Python API for interacting with deployed smart contracts, simplifying tasks such as function calls, event listening, and data retrieval. This includes automatic ABI parsing and transaction construction.
*   **On-Chain Event Triggers:** Allows users to define triggers based on specific events emitted by smart contracts. These triggers can initiate automated workflows when predefined conditions are met. For example, a trigger can be set to execute a trade when a specific price is reached on a decentralized exchange.
*   **Gas Optimization Strategies:** Employs advanced techniques such as batching transactions, using gas tokens, and optimizing smart contract code to minimize transaction costs. This ensures efficient execution of automated workflows, especially for complex scenarios involving multiple interactions.
*   **Transaction Sequencing and Prioritization:** Enables developers to define the order in which transactions are executed and prioritize them based on urgency. This is crucial for scenarios where the timing of transactions is critical, such as arbitrage opportunities or time-sensitive payments.
*   **Decentralized Oracle Integration:** Supports integration with decentralized oracles to access real-world data, such as price feeds, weather information, or election results. This allows automated workflows to be triggered by external events, expanding the possibilities for on-chain automation.
*   **Modular and Extensible Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that allows developers to easily add new functionalities and customize the framework to their specific needs. This includes support for different blockchain networks, smart contract languages, and data sources.
*   **Detailed Logging and Monitoring:** Provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities to track the execution of automated workflows and identify potential issues. This includes real-time monitoring of transaction status, gas costs, and event triggers.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the framework's logic and API.
*   **Web3.py:** A Python library for interacting with Ethereum-based blockchains. Used for smart contract deployment, function calls, and event listening.
*   **Solidity:** The smart contract language used for deploying and interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.
*   **Infura/Alchemy:** Blockchain infrastructure providers used to connect to Ethereum and other networks.
*   **Redis:** An in-memory data store used for caching and managing event triggers.
*   **Celery:** A distributed task queue used for asynchronous execution of automated workflows.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/ChronoForge.git
    cd ChronoForge

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4.  **Install Ganache-cli (optional, for local testing):**
    npm install -g ganache-cli

## Configuration

1.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the following environment variables:

    WEB3_PROVIDER_URI="your_web3_provider_uri"  # e.g., Infura or Alchemy endpoint
    PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key" # The private key of the Ethereum account used to deploy and interact with smart contracts.
    REDIS_HOST="localhost" # Redis host
    REDIS_PORT=6379 # Redis port

2.  **Configure the `config.py` file:**
    Review and modify the `config.py` file to configure settings such as:
    *   Default gas price
    *   Confirmation blocks for transactions
    *   Network ID
    *   Smart contract addresses (after deployment)

## Usage

1.  **Deploy Smart Contracts:**
    Use the provided deployment scripts in the `contracts` directory to deploy your smart contracts to the chosen blockchain network. Update the `config.py` file with the deployed contract addresses.
    Example script (requires web3.py and compiled contract ABI):
    

2.  **Define Event Triggers:**
    Use the ChronoForge API to define event triggers that initiate automated workflows based on specific smart contract events.
    Example:
    

3.  **Implement Automation Logic:**
    Create Python functions that define the actions to be taken when an event trigger is activated. These functions can interact with smart contracts, perform calculations, or execute other tasks.
